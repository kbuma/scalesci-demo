Game:\n   - Purpose: Represents the Tic Tac Toe game and manages the game flow.\n   - Methods:\n     - `start_game()`: Starts the game and manages the game loop.\n     - `display_board()`: Displays the current state of the game board.\n     - `get_user_move()`: Prompts the user for their move and validates the input.\n     - `make_user_move(move)`: Updates the game board with the user's move.\n     - `make_computer_move()`: Generates a random move for the computer and updates the game board.\n     - `check_game_over()`: Checks if the game is over (win, lose, or draw).\n     - `ask_play_again()`: Asks the user if they want to play another game.\n\n2. Board:\n   - Purpose: Represents the game board and manages the state of the board.\n   - Methods:\n     - `initialize_board()`: Initializes the game board with empty squares.\n     - `update_board(move, symbol)`: Updates the board with the given move and symbol.\n     - `is_valid_move(move)`: Checks if the move is valid (within the board boundaries and the square is empty).\n     - `is_board_full()`: Checks if the board is full (no empty squares remaining).\n     - `check_winner(symbol)`: Checks if the given symbol has won the game.\n\nNow, let's proceed with creating the necessary files and their content.\n\n**game.py**\n```python\nfrom board import Board\nimport random\n\nclass Game:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.board = Board()\n        self.current_player = \"X\"\n\n    def start_game(self):\n        print(\"Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!\")\n        self.board.initialize_board()\n        self.display_board()\n\n        while True:\n            if self.current_player == \"X\":\n                move = self.get_user_move()\n                self.make_user_move(move)\n            else:\n                self.make_computer_move()\n\n            self.display_board()\n\n            if self.check_game_over():\n                break\n\n            self.current_player = \"O\" if self.current_player == \"X\" else \"X\"\n\n        self.ask_play_again()\n\n    def display_board(self):\n        print(\"Current Board:\")\n        for row in self.board.board:\n            print(\" | \".join(row))\n            print(\"---------\")\n\n    def get_user_move(self):\n        while True:\n            move = input(\"Enter your move (row column): \")\n            try:\n                row, col = map(int, move.split())\n                if self.board.is_valid_move((row, col)):\n                    return (row, col)\n                else:\n                    print(\"Invalid move.

The `game.py` file serves as the entry point for the game, while the `board.py` file contains the logic for managing the game board.\n\nBefore finishing, let's double-check that all parts of the architecture are present:\n- The `Game` class in `game.py` manages the game flow, including starting the game, displaying the board, getting user input, making moves, checking for game over conditions, and asking to play again.\n- The `Board` class in `board.py` represents the game board and provides methods for initializing the board, updating the board with moves, validating moves, checking for a full board, and checking for a winner.\n\nThe code is now ready to be executed as a text-based Tic Tac Toe game in the console."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To install the necessary dependencies and run the codebase, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Install Python (if not already installed):\n   ```bash\n   # Check if Python is already installed\n   python3 --version\n\n   # If Python is not installed, install it\n   # For macOS or Linux\n   brew install python3\n\n   # For Windows\n   choco install python\n   ```\n\n2.

Install the required dependencies:\n   ```bash\n   # Install the dependencies using pip\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n4. Run the Tic Tac Toe game:\n   ```bash\n   # Run the game.py file\n   python game.py\n   ```\n\n   The game will start and you can play Tic Tac Toe in the console.\n\nNote: If you encounter any issues during the installation or execution, please make sure you have the necessary permissions and that the codebase is located in the current directory."}]
