The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are:

1. `lat_lon()`: A function to get the map projection and the lat and lon values from the WRF data.
2. `butter_bandpass_filter()`: A function to filter variables for waves with periods between 3-5 days using a Butterworth bandpass filter.
3. `plot_eke()`: A function to generate the plot for the EKE distribution.
4. `main()`: The main function that performs the computation and generates the plot.

Now, let's proceed with the implementation of the code.
